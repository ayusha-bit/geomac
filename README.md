<h1>Geomac</h1>
<p><strong>Geomac</strong> helps you to find the geographic location of Wi-Fi access points by their MAC addresses (also
   known as BSSIDs). Geomac receives data about the location of access points from network geolocation
   providers (such as Apple, Google, Microsoft, Mylnikov and Yandex), which, in turn, collect this data
   through crowdsourcing in their mobile applications.

<p>This program may be useful for OSINT experts, wireless network researchers and wardrivers.</p>
